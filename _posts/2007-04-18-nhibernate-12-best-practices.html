One of my former collegues pointed me at a great <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/NHibernateBestPractices.asp">article</a> by Billy McCafferty which will be one of my classics. It deals with many great design and architectural patterns and the tools available to implement those patterns in a real-live production-ready enterprise solution. It's a great document for enjoying a afternoon full of architectural discussions with your coworkers...
