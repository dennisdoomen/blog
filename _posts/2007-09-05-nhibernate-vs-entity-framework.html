<p>Although Microsoft <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/memilavi/archive/2007/09/04/entity-framework-another-or-m.aspx">claims</a> that the new Entity Framework is really not an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">OR/M</a> product, if you look closely at the examples and the whitepapers,&nbsp;you'll agree&nbsp;with me that they are very similar. Nhibernate is an awesome product, and I've been using it for a long time now, but it currently has two major drawbacks. First, there are no&nbsp;serious GUI tools assisting in the creation of mapping files and/or business classes. Second, various <a href="http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=977630&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">rumours</a> indicate that further development (other than bugfixes) is uncertain at this time. Well, if you tried the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=09a36081-5ed1-4648-b995-6239d0b77cb5&amp;displaylang=en">Entity Framework tools</a> for Visual Studio 2008, you must love the integrated environment. And obviously, LINQ is much better than NHibernate's expression&nbsp;object model&nbsp;and HQL language. Nevertheless, until we have support for the major important database vendors, the EF is no real competiter yet. Luckely, there is good <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2007/06/15/database-vendors-discuss-the-entity-framework-and-linq-at-teched.aspx">news</a> on the horizon.</p> <p>PS. If you have problems trying to get the CTP tools to work, see this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2007/09/04/entity-framework-tools-ctp-package-load-failure-workaround.aspx">post</a>. It might help.</p>
