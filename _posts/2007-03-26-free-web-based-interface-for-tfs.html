This is certainly incredible. One day after I blogged about my complaints on Team Foundation Server (especially its lack of a web-based interface), Microsoft announced that they've acquired <a href="http://www.devbiz.com/">DevBiz Business Solutions</a>, the creators of TeamPlain, the best commercial TFS-based product available. And what's best, you can <a href="http://www.devbiz.com/teamplain/webaccess/download.aspx">download </a>it for free starting right now! I'm sure going to try it first thing in the morning.<br /><br />Oh yes, and not to forget, Microsoft released a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/de-de/teamsystem/bb407307.aspx">new roadmap </a>for Visual Studio Team System, including the post-"Orcas" product, codenamed Rosario.
