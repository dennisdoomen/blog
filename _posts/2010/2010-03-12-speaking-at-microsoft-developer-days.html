<p>Thanks to all the voters who voted for my wildcard proposal on Entity Framework 4.0, I will be speaking at the Microsoft Developer Days 2010, again. Last year, the whole wildcard thingy was a bit fuzzy, but this year, the organization has gone through great lengths to seriously include us wildcard speakers in the entire planning process. </p><p>I’ll be speaking on March 30st, at 11:05. I’m not sure about the room number yet, but I do know it should be able to handle up to 80 attendees. Check out the most recent <a href="http://www.devdays.nl/Agenda.aspx?pid=66&amp;lang=nl">schedule</a> here.</p><p>Now I still have to decide whether to move to Visual Studio 2010 RC before the conference. I probably have to to evaluate CTP 3 which is essential when looking at the Code Only features (oh, sorry, Code First), so might have to. Shame that we don’t have SIlverlight 4 yet in the RC build.</p>
