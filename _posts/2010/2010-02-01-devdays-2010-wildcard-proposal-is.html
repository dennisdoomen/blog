<p>Introduced in the 2009 edition, this yearâ€™s <a href="http://www.devdays.nl/">Microsoft Developer Days</a> is again offering wildcard sessions to anyone who posted a proposal on their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=feed&amp;story_fbid=236315888061&amp;gid=192736623061&amp;ref=mf#/group.php?v=wall&amp;ref=mf&amp;gid=192736623061">Facebook</a> site. Obviously I posted a proposal as well, and partly thanks to the community and partly because there were only eight proposals, my proposal is now available on the DevDays site for voting. Support me by going over <a href="http://www.devdays.nl/WildCardSessions.aspx?pid=69&amp;lang=nl">here</a> and <a href="http://www.devdays.nl/WildCardSessions.aspx?pid=69&amp;lang=nl">voting</a> for my session.</p>
