<p>Last week we put our first full-blown Silverlight 4 line-of-business application into production, and just yesterday, we’ve run into our first production issue. Consider the width specifications of the DataGrid columns in this XAML fragment:</p> <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sv2gnsft17w/TOI-ATmmvII/AAAAAAAAHDs/eIwcLGFsPT0/s1600-h/image%5B5%5D.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: ; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_sv2gnsft17w/TOI-BHLCbCI/AAAAAAAAHD0/f2YxPbQTlis/image_thumb%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="493" height="145"></a></p> <p>This XAML file was generated by Expression Blend and has not caused any problems throughout the development phase and during user acceptance tests. However, on one particular Windows XP/IE7 system it caused a crash, even though all systems were using Silverlight 4.0.50917.0. After a bit of investigation we learned that by design a star-sized specification should include an integer and not a double. The big mystery is why this is not detected by the compiler and why it works on all other systems…</p>
