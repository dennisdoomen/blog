<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>  <p>A formal review of all code and artifacts related to a requirement or task by another person than the original developer. Rework because of review comments must be revalidated afterwards.</p>  <p><strong>Why would you do that?</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Because the <i>average</i> developer       <ul>       <li>introduces 10-50 bugs per 1000 lines of code (at least, according to Moore’s Law) </li>        <li>is not always aware of the potential pitfalls of particular code constructs (hence coding guidelines) </li>        <li>is not always up to date with all available constructs in a new C# version </li>        <li>does not have full awareness of all the out-of-box solutions offered by the .NET Framework, open-source sites or commercial vendors </li>        <li>often does not realize that an ingenious and elegant solution may be too complex to understand by others. </li>        <li>sometimes loses sight of the overall solution and the initial goal when working on a some piece of code too long. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Because it helps improve the awareness of, and the understanding behind your company’s coding guidelines. </li> </ul>  <p>Notice that the amount of necessary review work can be reduced by introducing the Pair Programming practice.</p>  <p><strong>What’s the bare minimum you need to do?</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Find issues in the interpretation of the functional requirements. </li>    <li>To verify compliance against your coding guidelines or standards. </li>    <li>If you don’t have one, consider the <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/archive/2009/03/06/new-coding-guidelines-for-c-3-0.aspx">Aviva Solutions C# 3.0 Coding Guidelines</a>. Notice that these are an extension to Visual Studio’s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3z0aeatx.aspx">Code Analysis</a>, so the latter is still worthwhile. </li>    <li>To find any loose ends such as TODOs or incomplete code. <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/">Resharper 4.5</a> includes a nice tool window that quickly shows an overview of all TODOs in your current solution. Resharper 5.0 even includes solution-wide analysis that finds dead code. </li>    <li>To ensure that all code is easy to read and understand. For instance, all members and types have a comprehensive name and non-trivial code is annotated with code comments. </li>    <li>To ensure that each and every check-in improves the code base, rather than introducing software rot. </li> </ul>  <p><b></b></p>  <p><b>What’s the usual thing to do?</b></p>  <ul>   <li>To ensure that all naming of code elements matches those of the functional design, preferably using <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/">Domain Driven Design</a>’s <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/132">Ubiquitous Language</a>. </li>    <li>To check for the usual pitfalls such as God classes or methods that are way too long. </li>    <li>To find any redundant code or code that is unnecessarily complex and requires refactoring. </li>    <li>To find any code constructs that may put other developers on the wrong foot and therefore jeopardize future maintenance. </li>    <li>To find code constructs that can be replaced with a simple call to a previously developed generic class or .NET Framework construct. </li>    <li>To stimulate the use of design principles such as <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/03/07/pablo-s-topic-of-the-month-march-solid-principles.aspx">S.O.L.I.D.</a> or the design patterns defined by the likes of Martin Fowler and Eric Gamma so that the overall code quality increases. </li> </ul>  <p><b>How do you do that?</b></p>  <ul>   <li>It is important to make sure that all files related to a particular piece of functionality can be easily found. Use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181459.aspx">Check-in Policy</a> to associate each and every change with a corresponding work item such as a Scenario, Task or Bug. Since a major change may involve multiple check-ins, especially in a larger team where multiple developers work in the same areas of your code base, Change Sets provide insufficient traceability. </li>    <li>Use a logging form or something similar to review every piece of code related to a particular work item and store it on the project’s team site. </li>    <li>Alternatively, copy and paste the code into Microsoft Word, and use its reviewing features to annotate the code with comments and improvements. </li>    <li>Or even better, install <a href="http://teamreview.codeplex.com/">TeamReview</a> and its corresponding Review Response work item and add review comments directly from inside Visual Studio’s code editor, while keeping them together under the associated work item. Also check-out <a href="http://www.newdrp.com/Posters/SDLCwithVSTS/tabid/70/id/227/Default.aspx">this</a> poster illustrating the underlying review workflow. </li> </ul>
