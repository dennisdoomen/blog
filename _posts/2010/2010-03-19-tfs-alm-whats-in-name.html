<p>In response to my posts on <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2010/02/tfs-development-practices-part-2-peer.html">Peer Reviews</a>, <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2010/03/tfs-development-practices-part-3-unit.html">Unit Testing &amp; TDD</a>, and <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2010/03/tfs-development-practices-part-4-common_15.html">Common Code Layout</a>, someone noticed that all these posts were part of my Team Foundation Server Development Practices series, but not every post actually mentioned TFS. Obviously, he was right. The reason for using the TFS prefix is that our company is heavily using TFS as a platform for supporting Application Lifecycle Management. Most of the practices I talk about include a lot of practical advice on how to get the most out of the TFS product suite. Nevertheless, I’ve renamed the series to ALM Practices to better emphasis the real purpose of it. So what’s planned?</p><ul><li>Code Analysis &amp; Coding Standards </li><li>Refactoring </li><li>Automatic Builds &amp; Continuous Integration </li><li>Checklists </li><li>Work Item Tracking &amp; Tracibility </li><li>Architectural &amp; Technological Audits </li><li>Pair Programming </li></ul>
