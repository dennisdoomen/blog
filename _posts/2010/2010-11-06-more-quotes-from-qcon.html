<p>Well, <a href="http://qconsf.com/">QCon 2010</a> is over, so it is time to travel back to the Netherlands and finally see my wife and daughter again. However, after the <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2010/11/quotes-from-qcon.html">previous</a> post, the quotes have been coming in on Twitter space. So, to complete one of the most intense conferences ever, here are some more funny, inspiring and brain hurting quotes.  <p><strong>About architecture, technology and tools</strong> <ul> <li>"All problems can be solved by another level of indirection, except for the problem of too many layers of indirection"</li></ul> <ul> <li>"Nothing scales like a stateless service" <li>"Erik (Meijer) just mathematically proved thatNoSQL is really coSQL" <li>"Given enough time and perseverity, you can create any query model on top of any storage model" (Michael Nygard) <li>"How do you tell the difference between a startup and an enterprise? In a startup, everybody knows the administrator password" <li>"If you do it more than twice, script it." (Randy Shoup about automation being key in the cloud)</li></ul> <ul> <li>"Technology without purpose is squat" (Rod Barlow)</li></ul> <ul> <li>"XML is like violence.
