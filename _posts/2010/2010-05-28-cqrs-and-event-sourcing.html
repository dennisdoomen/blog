<p>Yesterday evening I did a talk on building a .NET-based system using Command Query Responsibility Segregation and Event Sourcing. We had a lot of awesome discussions on its applicability, and as usual, I ran out of time again. I could have easily spend a full day on this subject, but unfortunately, I only had about 1 hour and 45 minutes to my disposal. </p>  <p>All code is available as a <a href="http://thecqrskitchen.codeplex.com/">CodePlex project</a> and I’ll be continuing development on the demo application so that it includes all major and all corner cases. I’m going to try to make it a great reference for anybody whose intention is to start building CQRS-based systems.</p>  <div style="width: 425px" id="__ss_4337395"><strong style="margin: 12px 0px 4px; display: block"><a title="CQRS and Event Sourcing, An Alternative Architecture for DDD" href="http://www.slideshare.net/dennisdoomen/cqrs-and-event-sourcing-an-alternative-architecture-for-ddd">CQRS and Event Sourcing, An Alternative Architecture for DDD</a></strong><object id="__sse4337395" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=cqrseventsourcingdotned2010-05-100528004537-phpapp01&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=cqrs-and-event-sourcing-an-alternative-architecture-for-ddd" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><embed name="__sse4337395" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=cqrseventsourcingdotned2010-05-100528004537-phpapp01&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=cqrs-and-event-sourcing-an-alternative-architecture-for-ddd" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>    <p></p> </div>
