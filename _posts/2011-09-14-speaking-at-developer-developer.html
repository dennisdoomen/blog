<p>I’m honored to have been selected to speak at my first event in the United Kingdom, <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/">Developer Developer Developer North</a>, hosted at the <a href="http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/">University of Sunderland</a>, near New Castle.</p> <p>Our job as a software developer seems to revolve mostly around programming languages, frameworks and Visual Studio. And to be honest, most of us have their hands full with that already. However, our profession includes a whole bunch of best practices that can seriously improve the efficiency and effectiveness of you and your teams, help you to deliver at a higher quality, or involve the business even more.  <p>What am I talking about? Well, think about Unit Testing (and TDD/BDD), Peer Reviews, Daily builds &amp; Continuous Integration, Brown Paper Sessions, Coding Standards, Common Code Layout, Static Code Analysis, Refactoring, Evolutionary Design, Checklists and Pair Programming. At DDD North I’ll be talking about what those practices are about and why should include them in your toolbox.</p>
