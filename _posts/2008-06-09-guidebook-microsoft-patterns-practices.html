<p>In the beginning of this year, <a href="http://nucleusresearch.com/" target="_blank">Nucleus Research</a> has been interviewing several architects from the .NET community with the intention of writing a whitepaper on the added value of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft's patterns &amp; practices</a>. As an expert advisor to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc487895.aspx" target="_blank">Web Service Software Factory : Modeling Edition</a>, I was interviewed as well, and I'm happy to see that some of my quotes have been used in the paper. Unfortunately, the writers forgot to properly spell out our company name and mentioned Aviva only. Anyway, check out this <a href="http://nucleusresearch.com/library/microsoft-roi/i19.pdf" target="_blank">link</a> to read the paper.</p>
