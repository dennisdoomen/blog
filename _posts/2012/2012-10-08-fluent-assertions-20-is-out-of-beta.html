<p>After six weeks of beta testing, it is time to remove the beta mark from Fluent Assertions 2.0. Since the beta was released, we fixed several little bugs that you won’t notice, but the original <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2012/08/breaking-with-past-orfluent-assertions.html">release notes</a> still apply. Release 2.0 adds a lot of new features and improvements, most noticeably the <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2012/09/asserting-object-graph-equivalence.html">new syntax</a> for comparing complex object graphs and support for .NET 4.5, Windows 8 Apps and Windows Phone 7.5 (Mango). You can get a copy of the zip through the CodePlex <a href="http://fluentassertions.codeplex.com/releases/view/82423">download page</a>, but I suspect most of you will use the <a href="http://fluentassertions.codeplex.com/releases/view/82423">NuGet package</a> instead. </p> <p>For those who’d like to provide contributions, make note that we are now on a GIT repository, so we will accept your pull requests. And as usual, for questions, remarks or suggestions, you can use the <a href="http://fluentassertions.codeplex.com/discussions">Discussions</a> page, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fluent-assertions">StackOverflow</a>, or you can contact me directly by <a href="mailto:dennis.doomen@avivasolutions.nl">email</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/ddoomen">Twitter</a>.</p>
