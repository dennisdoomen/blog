<p>Since my <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2010/09/some-thoughts-on-wcf-data-services-and.html">first blog post</a> on the <a href="http://silverlightcookbook.codeplex.com/">Silverlight Cookbook</a> in September 2010, I’ve invested a lot of private time in sharing my best practices on building line-of-business application in Silverlight. I <a href="http://silverlightcookbook.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets">shared</a> my code on CodePlex, wrote an entire <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/search/label/Cookbook">series of blog posts</a>, and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dennisdoomen/introducing-the-silverlight-cookbook">talked</a> about the Cookbook at several events.</p> <p>Times change, and although <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2011/05/choosing-right-web-technology-for.html">I’ve always believed</a> (and still do) that Silverlight is a great technology for building interactive line-of-business applications, the lack of a roadmap for Silverlight is making even my clients hesitate. And yes, I did explain them about Microsoft officially supporting Silverlight 5 until 2021.</p> <p>To help me make a decision about the direction of the Cookbook, I’ve started a <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/">poll</a> in the side-bar of my blog. The important question I ask is whether I should continue with Silverlight, move towards Windows 8 Apps (in XAML/C# of course), or finally make the jump to HTML5/JavaScript. The few votes I’ve received so far tend to lean towards the latter, but I’m not willing to make that jump until more people have voted. </p> <p>So let know!</p>
