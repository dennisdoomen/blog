<span style="font-family: inherit;">A recurring topic in every project I've been involved with is when and where you should use XML comments and/or annotate classes and members with proper documentation. I've always been </span><a href="https://github.com/dennisdoomen/csharpguidelines/blob/master/Guidelines/2300_DocumentationGuidelines.md"><span style="font-family: inherit;">very specific</span></a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> about this, but in real live I meet a lot of developers who don't seem to care about this, or worse, they reject the entire concept. Some of these people claim that the only real documentation is the code itself. And although I fully agree that a well-factored and properly named class is a crucial element in achieving a maintainable code base, proper documentation is just as important.</span><br /><div style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin: 0in;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZbAWRJHbwFE/Vgy4XgZGGHI/AAAAAAAAKU8/_jCyGSx86SE/s1600/Untitled%2Bpicture.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="140" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZbAWRJHbwFE/Vgy4XgZGGHI/AAAAAAAAKU8/_jCyGSx86SE/s400/Untitled%2Bpicture.png" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In my opinion, these three kinds of documentation are required for every professional code base.</span></div><ul style="direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0in; unicode-bidi: embed;" type="disc"><li style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Class-level and member-level      documentation helps you understand what behavior to expect without having      to jump into the actual implementation details. It should also explain the&nbsp;</span>responsibilities<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;the roles the class plays in the overall design, or      the member within the class. This kind of documentation is not a      replacement for proper naming. Both are crucial, and one should reinforce      the other. So always document the expected behavior of all your public and      protected members. But, don't add documentation that repeats the name of      the member. I'd rather have no documentation at all than that kind of      useless crap.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">          &nbsp;</span></li><li style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Inline comments, which you      should use scarcely, are there to help you understand the thought process      the original developer went through, to point you in the right direction,      or to emphasize a particular non-trivial design decision. I use the word </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">scarcely</span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"> purposely, because in most      cases, refactoring the code can help you avoid the need to have in-line      comments. For instance, wrapping a complex expression in a method which      name explains the goal of the algorithm can already make your code a lot      easier to understand. Robert C. Martin's book </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clean Code</span></a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> contains numerous of these      refactorings. <br />          &nbsp;</span></li><li style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Commit comments should not      only explain the nature of the change, but more importantly, why a      particular change was needed in the first place. When a lot of people are      involved, it becomes pretty important to be able to see why something that      happened a long time ago happened. Yeah, an internal blog can help, but&nbsp;</span>ultimately<span style="font-family: inherit;">, itâ€™s the source control history that will contain&nbsp;the really      interesting changes. I've seen numerous&nbsp;</span>occasions<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;where I noticed some      code that seem to be superfluous, but ended up being quite critical. The      commit message for that change helped me understand why. Unfortunately      I've also seen less helpful commit messages requiring me to figure out the      reason the hard way. </span></li></ul><span lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: inherit;">So what do you think? Do you properly document your code? Does code documentation help you use an API?
