In this post, I'll be talking about the source control system only. Both <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Online</a> (Microsoft's TFS-in-the-cloud), <a href="https://github.com/features/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> support this heavily. We use GitHub ourselves, but I've noticed that Microsoft made some considerable improvements since we moved away from TFS. </span></div><div lang="nl" style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tvJf5Pp-aSg/VY0R8gIeuZI/AAAAAAAAKSg/CCoLiB_YzuQ/s1600/Softwaredeployment-met-Git-en-SVN-via-SSH.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="188" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tvJf5Pp-aSg/VY0R8gIeuZI/AAAAAAAAKSg/CCoLiB_YzuQ/s400/Softwaredeployment-met-Git-en-SVN-via-SSH.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div style="margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div lang="nl" style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div lang="nl" style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Anyway, in January 2014, after three years with TFS, we finally moved to Git. With 1.5 years of experience, I think we're entitled to having an opinion about how they compare. To help me compile this post, I asked my colleagues about things they can do now they couldn't do when we were still using TFS's centralized source control system. One word of disclaimer though.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><ul style="direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0in; unicode-bidi: embed;" type="disc"><li lang="nl" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can create and merge      branches in seconds rather than minutes (or hours if your project is      anything but trivial). Switching between branches happens in milliseconds      rather than the typical 15-30 minutes in our projects. This completely      changes the way you work. It allows a level of isolation that is      inpossible to achieve with a centralized source control system.<br />          &nbsp;</span></li><li lang="nl" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Pull Requests</a> (PR), a feature supported by      all online Git platforms is a crucial tool for teams to break down complex      software systems in components owned by teams without blocking anybody. It      allows developers to make a kind of copy of projects they don't own, create      branches, work on improvements and new features, and then send a request      to the owning team to <span style="font-style: italic;">pull</span> in their changes. Pull Requests are the single best way      to scale a software development organization into multiple autonomous teams.<br />          &nbsp;</span></li><li lang="nl" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">How often did you encounter      useless comments like "Oops, I broke the build" or "Some      review rework". You can clean up the history of a feature branch      before you merge it to its final location by using an <span style="font-style: italic;">interactive      rebase</span> to amend      existing commits (the equivalent of a TFS changeset), squashs a couple of      commits together, or to fix up those commit comments. <br />          &nbsp;</span></li><li lang="nl" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Developers can work in      parallel on the same branch by merging with other team members, either      from the central repository or on <span style="font-style: italic;">forks </span>owned by individual team members. If they want,      they can use PRs to control what gets in the shared branch.<br />          &nbsp;</span></li><li lang="nl" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">So you've worked on that      feature for a week or so, but in the mean time, the main development      branch has been changed considerably. Wouldn't it be cool if you could      apply your changes on that newer branch as if you started from that      version in the first place? Well, that's what a Git rebase can do for you.      It keeps the history clean and avoids all those unreadable merges. <br />          &nbsp;</span></li><li lang="nl" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Compared to our time with      TFS, we have much less merge conflicts now are on Git. The main reason is      that Git does a <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/three-way-merging-a-look-under-the-hood/240164902">three-way merge</a> because it knows exactly      where two branches started to diverge. TFS typically does a pretty dumb      text-based merge. You also have a lot of control how merging should be      handled per file type in that particular project.<br />          &nbsp;</span></li><li lang="nl" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">You never have to check out      anything explicitly. Just edit it the file in whatever tool you prefer and      Git will pick that up. The project's .gitignore file ensure it will only      monitor specific files. If the net result of your changes is that you      didn't make changes at all, Git will not see that file as changed anymore.      Say goodbye to all those TFS changesets with unmodified files. We did try      TFS's Local Workspaces feature, but that collapsed with large      repositories.<br /><br /></span></li></ul><ul style="direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0in; unicode-bidi: embed;" type="disc"><li lang="nl" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Everything you can do online      you can do off-line. Last year, I was traveling through Switserland for a      couple of days. The simple fact you can branch, merge and rebase, all from      your local laptop is something you really start to value if you can do      that without an internet connection. This has become instrumental when the      internet connection of my client's project went down. You can even merge      with another colleague's repository over a local network share or USB      drive.<br /><br /></span></li></ul><ul style="direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0in; unicode-bidi: embed;" type="disc"><li style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Since Git treats branches as      a pointer at a linked list of commits, the entire source code, including      all branches and tags can be downloaded in minutes, if not seconds.<br /><br /></span></li></ul><ul style="direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0in; unicode-bidi: embed;" type="disc"><li style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And finally, even Microsoft      made the jump. Git is now the primary source control system for the      on-premise version of TFS as well as Visual Studio Online's. And Microsoft      is maintaining the entire .NET framework on Github. <br /><br /></span></li></ul><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin-left: .375in; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you still can't convince your boss with these arguments, tell your boss how much more productive you can be with Git. Or you can reverse that argument by telling him or her how much money he's throwing away every day by sticking with a centralized source control system.</span></div><div style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">So what do you think? Are you moving over soon? Did I miss any good arguments I should include? Did I exaggerate with any of this?
