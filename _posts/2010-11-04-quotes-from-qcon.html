<p>One of the funny things of this <a href="http://qconsf.com/">QCon</a> is the many tweets that the attendees have been throwing into the world wide web. That's great for a speaker because now they get immediate feedback on their performance, both good and bad. These are some of the quotes I found funny, inspiring or refreshing:  <p><strong>On testing</strong>  <ul> <li>Just because you have automated tests doesn't mean you shouldn't be doing manual testing (Martin Fowler)</li></ul> <ul> <li>Test is not a phase… (Martin Fowler)</li></ul> <p><strong>On tools &amp; deployment</strong>  <ul> <li>Beware!... a fool with a tool is still a fool (Martin Fowler)</li></ul> <ul> <li>If it hurts,do it more often,and bring the pain forward (Martin Fowler)  <li>How long would it take your org to deploy a 1 single line of code change (Mary &amp; Tom Poppendieck)  <li>If you're able to adapt, test and deploy a change very quickly, you don't have to worry too much about risk (Dan North)</li></ul> <ul> <li>Adam Messinger from oracle didn't show up to talk about the future of java.
