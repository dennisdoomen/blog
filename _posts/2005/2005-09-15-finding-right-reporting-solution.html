Within one of our projects we are in the process of selecting a reporting solution to can match Microsoft Access's reporting functionality. A couple of weeks ago, a Microsoft product manager gave a presentation on Sql Server 2005 and its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/2005ssrs.mspx">Reporting Services</a>. Today, a representative of Business Objects, the company that bought Crystal Decisions (known by their infamous Crystal Reports), gave a demonstration of <a href="http://www.businessobjects.com/products/reporting/default.asp">Business Objects XI</a> (pronounced as <em>Ex-Eye</em>). I was quite impressed by their .NET integration. You may have seen the Crystal Reports stuff that you get for free with VS.NET, but they have taken that package to a higher level. They provide a fully documented native .NET object model, a fancy Office 2003-like report designer, support for almost any kind of data source you may need, and various client/server mixtures. I'm eager to find out how those packages deliver their promises in reality. Will be continued....
