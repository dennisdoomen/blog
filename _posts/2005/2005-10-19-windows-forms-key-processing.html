If I had to name one thing in .NET that is very difficult to grasp, I would name Windows Forms key processing. There are so many methods involved it is very difficult to determine which method to overload and what to do. The newsgroup post <a href="http://groups.google.nl/group/microsoft.public.dotnet.framework.windowsforms/browse_thread/thread/b68d5daacb849913/fc4983017631514e?lnk=st&q=key+event+processing+group:microsoft.public.dotnet.*&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=nl#fc4983017631514e">Key Event Processing in Windows Forms</a> provides a great overview what happens during each key processing phase, but event with that it stays a troublesome subject.
