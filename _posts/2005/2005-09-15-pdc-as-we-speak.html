Maybe you've missed it, but in case you did, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/">2005 Professional Developers Conference</a> is ongoing as we speak. Check out the site and get updated on the latest Visual Studio 2005 and Longhorn articles, webcasts, and announcements. And while you're on it, ensure you assign <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">MSDN Blogs</a> as your start page and read what all those Microsoft developers and architects want to share with the community.
