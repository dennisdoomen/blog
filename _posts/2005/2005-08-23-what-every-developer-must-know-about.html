As a developer with long-time C++ experience I always felt quite comfortable with multi-threaded development. However, very often I discover that this comfortness is not shared by all developers. I lost count on how often I had to investigate some strange deadlock or race condition.<br />Fortunately, Vance Morrison of the MSDN Magazine published an interesting article named "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/08/Concurrency/default.aspx">What every dev must know about multithreaded apps</a>". It is rather lenghty, but gives a nice indepth look of the advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.
