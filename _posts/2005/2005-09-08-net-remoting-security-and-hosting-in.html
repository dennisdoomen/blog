In the last couple of days, I've suffered from some frustrating security issues related to a .NET Remoting object hosted in IIS. My current customer uses reasonably locked down development systems, and noone seems to know the real details of the security configuration. Fortunately, the article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/SecNetch11.asp">Building Secure ASP.NET Application</a> shed some light on the .NET/IIS security model allowing me to workaround the issues.
