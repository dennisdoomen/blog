I know that the article <em><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/05/c20/default.aspx">Create Elegant Code with Anonymous Methods, Iterators, and Partical Classes</a></em> is an oldie, but it still provides a comprehensive overview on what C# 2.0 really adds for the daily developer. It is written by Juval Lowy, one of Microsoft's Software Legends which I met once at a <a href="http://www.dotned.nl">Dutch .NET </a>meeting.
