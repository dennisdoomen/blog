One of things that I've always believed in is that throwing exceptions introduces a significant performance penalty. However, according to the article <em><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/ExceptionPerformance.asp">Performance Implications of Exceptions in .NET</a></em>, in reality it is not that bad at all. I haven't studied the exact context of the article, so take your own judgement.
