Microsoft has published the article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/bts_2004wp/html/14bc36a8-69a9-48ed-8e4c-1c85202544c0.asp">Understanding Microsoft Integration Technologies</a>. Once in a while I find myself having that creepy feeling when I discover that there is another Microsoft product that I don't know yet. This article provides a nice overview on MS's vision on enterprise integration, including the place of Biztalk 2006, Indigo, and SQL Server 2005.
