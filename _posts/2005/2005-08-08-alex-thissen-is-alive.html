Four years ago I took a .NET training given bij Twice IT (<a href="http://www.twice.nl">http://www.twice.nl</a>). Together with my best collegue Rinie Egas, we kept in contact. The last time we met him was at the Microsoft DevDays in The Hague. Since then I never heard anything anymore, until today. It seems he left Twice and is quite active in the .NET community.
