<p>Even though it was just a wildcard session (people had to vote for my proposal), the room had a capacity of only 50 people, and the DevDays organization forgot to list the wildcard sessions on the website, I was very happy to see that the room was more than full. Although I had quite a lot of content to cover and the pace of my session was quite high, I think it went very smooth. Since it is not possible to fill-in an evaluation form through the <a href="http://www.devdays.nl/">DevDays</a> site, hopefully, people drop me an <a href="mailto:dennis.doomen@avivasolutions.nl">email</a> or a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ddoomen">tweet</a> me with some feedback.</p>  <p>Anyhow, in case you want to review the slides or inspect the code Iâ€™ve used to create the demos and examples, get the slides from <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/Attachments/TDD%20and%20SOLID%20DevDays.ppt" target="_blank">here</a>, and the code from <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/Attachments/DevDays09Demos.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
