<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>  <p>Using Team Foundation Server’s User Story, Task and Bug work item types as the central unit of work for all the activities done within a project.</p>  <p><strong>Why would you do it?</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Because it adds traceability between the functional requirements and the way these requirements have been realized on a technical level. </li>    <li>Because it introduces a common view of the project between developers and the business people. </li>    <li>Because it allows you to keep track of why certain code changes were made. </li>    <li>Because it creates an automatic link between the work items representing functional changes, bug fixes and other code changes and the <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2010/07/alm-practices-part-8-automatic-builds.html">automatic builds</a>. </li>    <li>Because it reduces the chance of ending up with loose ends. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>What’s the usual thing to do?</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Track each and every activity that needs to be done in a project as a work item. </li>    <li>Use that work item as a central placeholder for all related communication, code changes, discussions, etc. </li> </ul>  <p><font color="#000000"><strong>How do you do that?</strong></font></p>  <ul>   <li>Register all functional and non-functional requirements as User Story work items and all bugs as Bug work items. </li>    <li>Also include non-coding related activities such as deployment activities, writing documentation, assisting the marketing department and such. This improves the transparency of the work that is done in a project. </li>    <li>Break these down into one or more linked Task work items and use these for each and every source control check-in. </li>    <li>If you are faced with a research task which is difficult to estimate, consider using a Spike with a time-boxed amount of work. </li>    <li>Never check-in anything without associating it with a task. </li>    <li>Never check-in anything without providing a clear description describing the set of changes (as Check-In Comments). </li>    <li>Use Check-In Policies to require developers to provide the comment and the associated work item(s). </li>    <li>Rigorously file all loose ends and ‘things to do at some time’ as a Task, preferably linked to the associated Bug or User Story. </li>    <li>Consider adding a custom <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2010/01/storyotypes-in-visual-studio-2010.html">Storyotype</a> field to the User Story work item type to differentiate between functional and non-functional requirements and to assist in scoping the User Stories. </li> </ul>
