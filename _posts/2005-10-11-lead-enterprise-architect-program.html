Me and some of my fellow collegues have been selected to join Microsoft's Lead Enterprise Architect Program (LEAP). Today, we received access to a dedicated portal that is used to keep us up to date on the program's presentations, reading materials, preparation guides, etc, and boy we have lots to read! As usual I have to find some spare time to get through all of this before the 28th (the first training day).
