<p>Last Sunday, the 22nd of February, my wife gave birth to a beautiful little girl listening to the name Teddie. She was born at 14:24 in the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis in Delft and her weight was 3940 grams. She is very healthy, but when her motherâ€™s water broke, we discovered that she dirtied her amniotic fluid. Therefore, to be safe, labor was continued in the hospital. Mother and daughter have stayed one night in the hospital for observation but are now comfortably at home.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_sv2gnsft17w/SaQaUAXc7qI/AAAAAAAACBw/d9QVFG0d9qQ/s1600-h/DSCF1004_small%5B4%5D.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="DSCF1004_small" border="0" alt="DSCF1004_small" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sv2gnsft17w/SaQaUjkjjzI/AAAAAAAACB0/nSvfCm6xzIw/DSCF1004_small_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="427" height="465" /></a></p>
