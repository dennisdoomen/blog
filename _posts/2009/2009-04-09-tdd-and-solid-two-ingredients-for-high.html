Many attempts have been made to improve the overal quality of our software development efforts, but if there's one I'd like to put some attention on, it's Test Driven Development. It's design-first, test-first approach has proved significant increases in overal quality. However, TDD is not easy and requires quite some understanding of proper object oriented design. S.O.L.I.D. is one of the better known acronyms referring to a set of very imporant design principles that both improve your ability to do TDD, but also make sure that your software is highly testable and maintainable.<br /><br />If you like to hear more about this on the coming Developer Days, give me a Thumbs Up at the <a href="https://www.devdays.nl/">DevDays09</a> site and help me into one of those <a href="https://www.devdays.nl/Media/Detail.aspx?id=15453643-de9f-4750-9670-296565385920">wilcard</a> sessions.<br /><br /><strong>Important Note</strong>: You must first register on the DevDays site, regardless of whether you're not sure yet you'll go.
