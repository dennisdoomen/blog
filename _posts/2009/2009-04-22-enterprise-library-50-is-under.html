<p>It’s a shame this year’s <a href="https://www.devdays.nl/">Microsoft Developer Days</a> does not cover anything of the work the Patterns &amp; Practices team is doing. However I know from first hand that they’re doing a very good job. A few weeks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2009/03/27/enterprise-library-5-0-tentative-product-backlog-published-story-feature-prioritization-is-open-your-participation-is-invited.aspx">ago</a>, you were given the opportunity to vote for your favorite feature or improvements, and now, they’ve delivered their first <a href="http://entlib.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=53908">drop</a>. And while you’re reading about it, notice that P&amp;P is actually using (a variation) of SCRUM, hence their reference to Sprints. </p>
