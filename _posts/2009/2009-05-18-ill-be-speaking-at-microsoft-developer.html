<p>Thanks to the many votes we received on our wildcard proposals from attendees, colleagues and community members, me, <a href="https://www.devdays.nl/Media/Detail.aspx?id=ffb83556-245e-4b18-8a01-d870692ffd6c">Pieter Joost van de Sande</a> and <a href="https://www.devdays.nl/Media/Detail.aspx?id=bac6f5d6-64e8-4899-88f5-e27ae5a99425">Dennis van de Stelt</a> have won a timeslot on next week’s Microsoft Developer Days. I’ll be talking about <strong>Test Driven Development and SOLID</strong> on Thursday May 28th at 15:00 in the conference room named Central America. </p>  <p>Many attempts have been made to improve the overall quality of our software development efforts, but if there's one I'd like to put some attention on, it's Test Driven Development. It's design-first, test-first approach has proved significant increases in overall quality. However, TDD is not easy and requires quite some understanding of proper object oriented design. S.O.L.I.D. is one of the better known acronyms referring to a set of very important design principles that both improve your ability to do TDD, but also make sure that your software is highly testable and maintainable.</p>  <p>Stuff I’ll be covering:</p>  <ul>   <li>What is quality? </li>    <li>Demonstrating Test Driven Development with a hands-on demo </li>    <li>The S.O.L.I.D. principles </li>    <li>Phases of unit testing </li>    <li>Examples illustrating the advantages of S.O.L.I.D. </li>    <li>Guidelines for getting started </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: You should be able to understand C# 3.0 and Lambda expressions, and feel at home amongst the principles of OO such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.</p>  <p>In the mean time, if you like to follow me on my daily activities until the DevDays, my Twitter account is <a title="http://twitter.com/dennisdoomen" href="http://twitter.com/dennisdoomen">http://twitter.com/dennisdoomen</a></p>
