<p>Open Space Code is a hands-on programming event following the Open Space format. The concept was borrowed (with permission) from the <a href="http://openspacecode.com/uk/london/2009-01-31.xhtml">Open Space Coding Day</a> that was held in the UK recently. Open Space events are more freeform than normal conferences, where all the interactivity is mostly found in coffee breaks. Mostly they're just great fun. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.clemensreijnen.nl/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/DutchOpenSpaceCodeDay2009_E2C8/twitter_2.png"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="twitter" border="0" alt="twitter" src="http://www.clemensreijnen.nl/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/DutchOpenSpaceCodeDay2009_E2C8/twitter_thumb.png" width="346" height="236" /></a></p>  <p>Announcements will be posted <a href="http://openspacecode.nl/">on this website</a> and on this Twitter account <a href="http://twitter.com/openspacecodenl">@openspacecodenl</a>, if you want to attend, send an email at <a href="mailto:info@openspacecode.nl">info@openspacecode.nl</a>.</p>  <p><strong>The target date is Saturday the 6th of June 2009 from 9.00 to 17.30, the target location is in Den Haag near the A4 but hasn't been confirmed yet.</strong></p>
