<strong>Update June 29th, 2010</strong><br />This document has just gone through a major update for both C# 3.0 and C# 4.0. Read more about it <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2010/06/coding-guidelines-for-c-30-and-c-40-now.html">here</a> and get the document from <a href="http://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com/">http://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com/</a>.<br /><br />I have been a long-time supporter of coding standards because I believe in its value as a way of improving overall code quality and helping inexperienced developers to gain more insight on the consequences of their work. I wrote my first <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/content/paperinfo/gemrcsharpcs.pdf">C# Coding Standard</a> together with Vic Hartog in 2003 for Philips Medical Systems, but have been refining these since then. However, I think every architect or lead developer should decide for himself whether or not he or she wants to comply with each and every rule, so I decided to refer to this document as Coding Guidelines rather than Coding Standard. <br />In the last couple of months Iâ€™ve been busy trying to revise this original document in order to come up with a version suitable for C# 3.0. And since Visual Studio has great support for automatic code checking using its Static Code Analysis feature, I decided to remove any overlapping rules and guidelines. The new document should be used as a companion to Code Analysis/FxCop and adds additional best practices that have proved to be very useful in my daily work as a consultant.
