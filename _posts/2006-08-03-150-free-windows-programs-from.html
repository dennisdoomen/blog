Blake Handler of <a href="http://roadtoknowwhere.com/">The Road To Know Where</a> has compiled an awesome list of free goodies from Microsoft. I haven't tried all but I did like the Vista-like Alt-Tab plugin. It shows a thumbnail of the application while alt-tabbing. I also saw some potentially interesting tools that I'm going to try out soon.
