I recently ended up in a discussion on when Event Sourcing is the right architecture style or not. As the universal answer to this question tends to be "it depends", I started thinking about the typical problems where I would use Event Sourcing. I came up with a couple of them, some more functional and some more technical:

* Auditing
* Replaying production issues
* Collaborative domains
* Apply new rules on existing data
* Temporal analysis
* Replication
* Out-of-place upgrades
* Off-line editing in a PWA
* Scaling out the read side
* Cross-domain communication
