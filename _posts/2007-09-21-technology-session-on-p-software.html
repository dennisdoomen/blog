<p>Maybe a bit late, but next Thursday, September 27th, I'll be&nbsp;presenting an open&nbsp;whiteboard session&nbsp;about the Patterns &amp; Practices software factories I've been using in&nbsp;my current&nbsp;customer project. Check out the <a href="http://www.dotned.nl/forums/thread/672.aspx">invitation</a> at DotNED. The invitation is in Dutch, but the presentation will be either in Dutch or English, depending on the audience. This is the same presentation I gave on September 7th and then we had about 20 people. Initially it was meant as an internal presentation, but we got some requests from other developers also. So we decided to open it up.</p>
