<p>This is a nice and funny <a href="http://blog.james-carr.org/?p=44">list of anti-patterns</a> that you may recognize, and like me, may have used in the past. I particularly like The Inspector and Generous Leftovers. It seems to be quite difficutl to write a decent and reliable unit test without falling into the same trap again. </p>
