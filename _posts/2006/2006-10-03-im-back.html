Well, because I've been very preoccupied with all kinds of things both personally and professionally, it has been a long while since I've posted. But I'm back! The contents of this blog will change considerably though. Recently, I've set-up a <a href="http://blog.smart-ms.ordina.nl">blog</a> for my employer Ordina, so I'll probably post all technical stuff on that blog and continue this blog with stuff from my personal life. So if you really want to keep up with what's up with me, you need to track both blogs. Fortunately, both have proper RSS feeds, so that should be easy.
