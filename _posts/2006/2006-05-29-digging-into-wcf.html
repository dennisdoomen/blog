I’ve just completed reading a great in-depth article on WCF written by Juval Lovy (founder of <a href="http://www.idesign.net/idesign/DesktopDefault.aspx">IDesign</a>). Those who have worked with .NET Remoting a lot may find this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/06/WCFEssentials/default.aspx">article</a> very useful since it deals with the WCF equivalence of .NET Remoting’s SingleCall and Singleton and more. I myself am going to attend a MasterClass WCF in June here in the Netherlands, so I’m sure I’ll get there well prepared.
