I’m in the second week of a diet from a book written by <a href="http://www.sonjabakker.nl">Sonja Bakker</a>. I was a bit skeptical, but the many success stories made me decide to try it anyhow. Well, in exactly two weeks, I’ve lost 6.5 kilograms, even though I actually committed terrible sins twice (by eating sate and having a BBQ). But for the remainder of the days I tried to stay as close as possible to the prescribed meals.
