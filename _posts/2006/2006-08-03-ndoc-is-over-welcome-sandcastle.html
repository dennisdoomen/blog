Kevin Downs, the leader of the NDoc project has thrown the towel in the ring (is that English btw?). He <a href="http://www.charliedigital.com/PermaLink,guid,95b2ab68-ba92-413a-b758-2783cde5df9c.aspx">claims </a>to not have received any support from the community or from Microsoft. That’s a shame. I’ve been using NDoc since 2001, and I was eagerly waiting for the moment a .NET 2.0 version would become available.<br />Unfortunately, Microsoft’s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/attachment/681209.ashx">Sandcastle</a> project is far from complete. With the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2006/07/29/682830.aspx">CTP</a>, it is very possible to compile a set of assemblies in a nice .CHM file, but it will still take a few months more before we get the nice user interface NDoc offered. Moreover, to get it to work for .NET 1.1, you need to perform a decent amount of <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SandcastleMicrosoftCTPOfAHelpCHMFileGeneratorOnTheTailsOfTheDeathOfNDoc.aspx">hacking</a>.
