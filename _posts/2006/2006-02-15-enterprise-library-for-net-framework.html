Lost month, Microsoft released an updated version of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/EntLib2.asp">Enterprise Library</a>. I haven't tried it yet, but from the documentation it does not seem te bring a lot of new features, other than compatibility with the 2.0 Framework. We have been using the May 2005 release for a long while now, and I can't ignore the many manual bugfixes we had to do to make it really work. Hopefully, Microsoft listened to the community.
