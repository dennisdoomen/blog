In several projects, I've been heavily using COM and other interop-related technologies. The pain with these technologies is that is often very difficult to track down bugs and interop mismatches. The same applies to working with No-Touch Deployment. Problems that occur while loading the application (assembly binding) are very difficult to analyse.<br />In Visual Studio 2005, Microsoft introduced Managed Debugging Assists that can help you detect those obscure problems and act accordingly.
