<p>While deeply mourning over losing&nbsp;my Idols Contest (well, a little bit), I visited <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/donsmith/">Don Smith</a>'s introduction of the P&amp;P's <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=6fde9247-53a8-4879-853d-500cd2d97a83">Web Service Software Factory</a>. Since we at Ordina have a lot of experience with software factories through its DSL-based <a href="http://www.ordinasoftwarefactory.nl/Default.asp/id,285/index.htm">SMART-Microsoft Software Factory</a>, I was eager to find out what Microsoft has been up to here. Their Service Factory is actually pretty cool. Although ours focusses more on&nbsp;leveraging the business domain&nbsp;(using DSL Designers), their's has a more technical origin. Using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/workshop/gat/">Guidance Application Toolkit</a> and a lot of wizards and dialogs, it provides guidance&nbsp;for tasks&nbsp;like generating the solution skeleton, securing your website, adding new WCF data and service contracts, and much more. Unlike SMART-Microsoft though, it does not support a fully functional object-relational mapper or any fancy model designers. Nevertheless, I think that both solutions can benefit from eachother very well. By combining them, you'll get the best solution&nbsp;for&nbsp;reaching the&nbsp;optimum&nbsp;business value&nbsp;while retaining the technical flexibility to match any possible scenario.</p>
