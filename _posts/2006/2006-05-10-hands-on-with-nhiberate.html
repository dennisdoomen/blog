You may have heard of NHiberate, the .NET variant of the famous Hibernate product, and you may understand the concept of an Object-Relational Mapper. But you may not have a clear picture of what it really can and does. Justin Gehtland published an <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=NHibernate">article</a> on <a href="http://www.theserverside.net">TheServerSide.net</a> that gives a quick introduction on how to configure NHibernate to map a domain model to a database model. The examples include one-to-many and many-to-many relations and inheritance.
