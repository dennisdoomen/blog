<p>Well, I just had my take in the 2006 TechED Idols Contest, and I lost. In the third&nbsp;wave, five contestants got a chance, but a Belgian student&nbsp;gave a fancy demo as if he has been doing that all his live. Well, I've tried and I give myself credits for that. The judges thought that I did have the skills, but appeared a bit unstructured (it was not clear what point I was trying to prove). Good&nbsp;remarks&nbsp;that I'm going to take into consideration next time.</p> <p>The Belgian guy was even better than the UK guy from the first wave and became the 2006 TechED Idol. Rumours (from our Ordina Belgium collegues) say that he already was in contact with some Microsoft guys and even may go to Redmond anyhow. Well,&nbsp;I preferred him over the UK guy anyway. He was really good.</p>
