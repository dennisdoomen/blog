<p>I recently posted about a problem I had while upgrading from Office 2007 Beta 2 to the final version. Somehow, the unstallation of beta 2 still left some pieces floating around on my harddisk. I then used a <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2006/11/uninstalling-microsoft-office-2007.html">manual workaround</a>, but in the mean time, I've also found a nice <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/myuninst.html">little tool</a> that really shows you what's installed. Should have saved me some time.</p>
