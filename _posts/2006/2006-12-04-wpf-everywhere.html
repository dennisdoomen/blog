<p>Codename WPF/E or <em>Windows Presentation Foundation Everywhere</em> in full, refers to&nbsp;the technology that allows lightweight XAML based applications to run within Internet Explorer, Firefox, or even Mac's Safari. To see what I'm talking about, download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2B01EC7E-C3B8-47CC-B12A-67C30191C3AA&amp;displaylang=en">CTP</a> from here, and then check out the samples from <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/playground/wpfe/">here</a>. According to several blogs, it's Microsoft's answer to Flash and other animation-oriented web-technologies. However, members of the community seem not to agree on whether it is purely based on Windows Presentation Foundation (such as mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/llobo/archive/2006/12/04/wpf-e-is-out.aspx">this blog</a>) or relies heavily on AJAX such as mentioned on the download site. &nbsp;</p>
