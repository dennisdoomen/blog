While reading this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/12/VisualStudioAddins/default.aspx">article</a>, I ran into two must-have tools which should have been part of Visual Studio from the beginning. First of all, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/alex_papadimoulis/archive/2004/05/25/141400.aspx">Smart Paster</a> is a handy tool for pasting a chunk of text into a source file in various nicely formatted formats. Secondly, <a href="http://www.jtleigh.com/people/colin/software/CopySourceAsHtml">Copy Source As HTML</a> allows you to copy a code snippet for use in your blog or website while maintaining the syntax coloring.
