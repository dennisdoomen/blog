If you live in the Netherlands, don't forget to subscribe for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netherlands/msdn/devdays/default.aspx">Microsoft Developer Days</a> that will happen in Amsterdam on the 7th and 8th of March. <a href="http://www.ordina.nl">Ordina</a> is one of main sponsors and will have a dedicated location on the show. As far as it looks now, I'm going to give a short demonstration of Ordina's DaVinci UML-based code generation framework.
