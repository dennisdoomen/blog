<p>Well, here we are at the fourth day of the 2006 TechED for Developers in Barcelona. Today I will to have to show the <a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/Teched/06/Pre/Static/Developers/SpeakerIdol.aspx">Idols Contest</a> jury what I have to offer on presentation skills. Unfortunately, yesterday evening&nbsp;was also the right time to be at the&nbsp;Dutch Country drink in Barcelona City Hall night club. Drinks were free, and I forgot that I'm not used to drink that many Bacardi&nbsp;Coke's anymore. </p> <p>Therefore, I decided to start the day with a highly&nbsp;interactive&nbsp;Whiteboard Discussion on best practices for using Team System (which is great for starting after a hangover). The session was&nbsp;hosted by two Team System MVPs&nbsp;so clearly these guys have a lot of experience.&nbsp;In fact, it already took 15 minutes just to prioritize the many requests from the audience, . Since I ran into many issues while working with Team System, I'd like to ask them a question or few! I&nbsp;sure am going to check-out their blogs later on. As a side note, I was now getting a little bit nervous for the Idols stuff during lunch...</p> <p>The next session was about the synchronization issues you run into with occasionally connected Smart Client applications. It was co-presented by Microsoft's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/">Brad Adams</a>, which is known for his books on .NET design guidelines. As part of&nbsp;Visual Studio&nbsp;'Orcas',&nbsp;they've been cooking up a framework that should help us&nbsp;creating applications that are as great to use as Microsoft Outlook even if you don't have a connected right now.&nbsp;This stuff is not yet available fully and it relies on SQL Server Compact Edition for the local database, but a CTP is supposed to arrive soon enough. </p>
