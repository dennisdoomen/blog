From a weather point-of-view, Eastern was quite good. I've visited Delft by bicycle for two days and enjoyed some nice beverages in the sun. However, it didn't finish well. Yesterday morning I discovered that somebody couldn't leave its hands off my car!!!! The lock was broken, the Pioneer <a href="http://www.pioneer.nl/nl/product_detail.jsp?product_id=7989&amp;taxonomy_id=25-121">DEH-P80MP</a> was gone, as well as my active subwoofer, my Rayban sunglasses, and some other stuff hidden in my armrest. Even worse, I would expect something like that to happen somewhere in the streets of Amsterdam, but not in the locked and private garage that our appartment building has. But the worst of it all, is that none of the equipment was secured. The lease company did not explicitly mention an important regulation that changed when they took over my lease contract from my former employer.
