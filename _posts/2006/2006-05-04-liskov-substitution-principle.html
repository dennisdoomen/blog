As Ordina is working on new C# 2.0 coding guidelines, last week I had a discussion with a colleague on object-oriented design. One important principle is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a> which in a C# context is often written as "<em>methods that use references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it</em>." I had quite some troubles explaining what it is really about, so I dug up an old (10 years) <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/lsp.pdf">article</a> written for C++ that still applies to modern-day languages. In fact, it also touches the subject of Design by Contract, another interesting principle that few use these days.
