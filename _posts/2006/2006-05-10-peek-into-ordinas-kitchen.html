Ordina is well known for its DaVinci platform and now offers you a chance to peek into our kitchen to see how we develop professional enterprise applications. You’ll get a chance to understand our development process, how we employ UML for generation purposes, and you can join a presentation on Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) and Ordina’s new DaVinci.SF. software factory Check out the <a href="http://www.ordina.net/openkeukendagen/Main.aspx">registration site </a>(it's in Dutch).
