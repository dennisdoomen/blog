<p>Yesterday, I finally convinced my girlfriend Barbara to join me in an effort to pick up a new desk for my desktop system. I wanted a desk with a nice curve in the corner and a dark color that fits the rest of our interior. </p> <p>Because of major redesigns, the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ms/nl_NL/local_home/delft.html">IKEA</a> in Delft is currently one big construction yard, so I was very happy to find a parking space in the vicinity of the building exit. Since we&nbsp;left directly after work, we quickly consumed an Ikea-style Tortellini with 15 (!) Swedish meatballs. And that is just the <em>normal</em> menu...</p> <p>I already had a brochure for the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?cattype=sub&amp;topcategoryId=15600&amp;categoryId=16137&amp;parentCats=15600&amp;storeId=9&amp;catalogId=10103&amp;langId=-22">Galant</a>-series with me, but to reach the self-service warehouse, you have to take the entire tour throughout the store. Unfortunately, after arriving in the huge warehouse, one of the employees explained us that we had to go back to the shop and let one of his colleagues prepare an order. Due to the construction activities, they had to move a part of their stock to another warehouse somewhere else in Delft. Gee, would have loved to know that before...</p> <p>Well, after taking the reverse tour back to the shop, we finally were ready to pick up the packages at the warehouse. But somehow, I expected that my 2006 Volkswagen Passat would be large enough to fit&nbsp;a 120 cm&nbsp;by 160 cm desk easily. How&nbsp;ignorant was I... the damn thing did not fit at all. You should have seen the angry face of my girlfriend (and my own stupid face) :-)</p> <p>Fortunately, we were able to pick up my girlfriend's father's Renault Scenic. With a bit of squeezing and pushing&nbsp;it just fitted. But since the door didn't close completely, we had to use a rope to keep it closed. I don't recall having driven as slow as 80 km/hour on a high-way...</p> <p>We arrived home at about 21:15. Since we left at 18:30 you can genuinely call it an evening with IKEA...</p>
