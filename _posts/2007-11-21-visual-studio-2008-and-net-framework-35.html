<p>I assume all of you know by now that Microsoft has released Visual Studio 2008 and the .NET Framework 3.5 to manufactoring. If you don't, you must be living in a cave or something. Nevertheless, if you want, you can download&nbsp;trial versions&nbsp;from <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx">here</a>. If you have an MSDN Premium subscription, then you can download the full Team Suite edition directly from <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/default.aspx">MSDN Subscriptions</a>.</p> <p>Since there have been so many different posts on this on the web, I've collected some of the more interesting ones right here.</p> <ul> <li>If you still have beta 2 or&nbsp;a previous build&nbsp;installed, check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/archive/2007/11/20/how-to-uninstall-vs-2008-beta-2-before-installing-the-final-version-of-vs-2008.aspx">this post</a>. It helps you uninstall any residual leftovers.  <li><a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog">Daniel Moth</a> is well-known for providing very detailed info on <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/11/top-10-things-to-know-about-visual.html">what's new</a> in Visual Studio 2008 and the .NET Framework 3.5. He has been my primary source for learning the nitty gritty.  <li>Although the Team Foundation Server version you can download from MSDN is a 90-day trial, it is safe to upgrade your existing servers. Upgrading to the retail version is just a matter of entering the appropriate license key. No reinstall necessary.  <li>An important <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ukvsts/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-has-rtm-ed.aspx">license change</a> (one which my current customer will be very happy with), is that you don't need a Client Access Licence (CAL) if you only use TFS for tracking defects.  <li>Brian Harry has blogged about planned upgrades for the TFS Power Tools and the TFS Web Access upgrades <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/11/20/upcoming-power-tool-release-for-tfs-2008.aspx">here</a>. If you can't wait, the current <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/09/21/vsts-web-access-updated-for-tfs-2008.aspx">CTP</a> will work with the RTM version.  <li>Jeff Beehler has compiled a comprehensive list of what's new in TFS&nbsp;2008 over <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-team-system-2008-ships.aspx">here</a>.  <li>The people responsible for the <a href="http://asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/samples/">AJAX Control Toolkit</a> have also releases a new version compatible with the final version of the .NET Framework. Download it from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=AtlasControlToolkit&amp;ReleaseId=8513">here</a>.  <li>The Visual Studio 2008 SDK has been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vsxteam/archive/2007/11/21/Visual-Studio-2008-SDK-1.0-and-Visual-Studio-2008-Shell-released.aspx">shipped</a> as well. Those who have been building custom DSL-based solutions, can now upgrade as well.  <li>The plan is to port the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8130">Web Service Software Factory : Modeling Edition</a>&nbsp;to Visual Studio 2008 and release it before the end of February 2008. However, Don Smith expects to have a CTP available before the end of the year, and maybe an alpha drop a bit earlier.  <li>Glenn Block, the product planner for the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf">Web Client Software Factory</a> told me that they plan to have a version in the beginning of next year. There is an article <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/ejadib/archive/2007/10/08/How_2D00_To_3A00_-Web-Client-Software-Factory-_2800_WCSF_2900_-_2600_-Visual-Studio-Orcas-Beta-2.aspx">though</a> that should allow you to modify the factory manually, but I haven't tried that yet.</li></ul>
