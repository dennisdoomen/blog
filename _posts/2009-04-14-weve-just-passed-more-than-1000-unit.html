In November 2008, me and some fellow colleagues have started working on a new project where we use Test Driven Development to gain a highly maintainable and highly testable system. Today, we have reached our 1000st unit test, or better, 'specification'. The term Test Driven is a bit misleading since TDD is really a design process, which has nice little granular unit tests as a side-effect. Anyway, we tried to reach this point before Eastern, but obviously we were professional enough not to add some dummy tests :-)<br /><p align="center"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_sv2gnsft17w/SeRofdX3DQI/AAAAAAAAC_4/0zxY5sWpfbE/s1600-h/1003unittests.png"><img style="WIDTH: 400px; HEIGHT: 207px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324495549128707330" border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_sv2gnsft17w/SeRofdX3DQI/AAAAAAAAC_4/0zxY5sWpfbE/s400/1003unittests.png" /></a></p>
