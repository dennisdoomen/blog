<p>I wonder how busy the Barcelona Airport is in the middle of the summer when all those&nbsp;people are transfered from and to&nbsp;coastal areas such as Calella, Lorett&nbsp;de Mar and Salou; it took us almost one hour just to&nbsp;check in. But Saturday&nbsp;afternoon, at around 15:30, I finally set foot on Dutch soil again. Damn, what a difference in weather conditions. It is only a two-hour flight, but we went from a sunny 20+ degrees Celcius to a windy and rainy 5-10 degrees. I think I'll immigrate to Spain when I have the time :-) </p> <p>Friday&nbsp;evening, we concluded our stay in Barcelona with a nice outside dinner at the Plaza Real while enjoying a&nbsp;nice&nbsp;glass&nbsp;of beer. At around midnight we decided to go visit the Baja Beach club just outside the city center and meet up with some of&nbsp;the people we met&nbsp;during the TechED. It is quite funny to see that this club is using the exact same formula&nbsp;as the&nbsp;equally named club in Rotterdam. In fact, by now, I know that they&nbsp;have the same owner, so not a coincidence after all. Since we needed to be at the airport at 10:00, we left the club to go to bed at around 2:30 in the middle of the night.</p>
