<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/">Tom Hollander</a>, Product Manager for Microsoft's Patterns &amp; Practices team, was at the TechED to share their future plans on software factories. Since we have been using the Domain Specific Language tools for almost a year now, Tom asked us to provide a 15 minute demonstration of our <a href="http://www.ordinasoftwarefactory.nl/Default.asp/id,285/index.htm">SMART-Microsoft Software Factory</a> in action. The session was labeled as a whiteboard session and was attended by about 80 people, mostly architects observed by the kind of questions we received. I shortly showed the different DSLs and what kind of code they generate. It was quite funny to see that several concerns from the audience on software factories were answered by the way we use DSLs in a real-live solution.
