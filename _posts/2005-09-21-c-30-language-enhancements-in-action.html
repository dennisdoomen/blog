While browsing the MSDN site, I ran into <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/0/9503e33e-fde6-4aed-b5d0-ffe749822f1b/csharp%203.0%20language%20enhancements%20hands%20on%20lab.doc">this</a> lab that provides a surprisingly detailled hands-on experience with C# 3.0 and LINQ. I read the article, and as far as I understand it, the major features of C# 3.0 include the ability to write less code for the same constructs, and an abstract query language that may potentially elliminate SQL.<br />Well, you can't blame Microsoft for being slow.... Visual Studio 2005 is not even released yet...
