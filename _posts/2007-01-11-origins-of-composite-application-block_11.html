<p>Last year, during our visit to the Microsoft campus in Redmond, I got a chance to talk to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa699394.aspx">Brenton Webster</a>, a&nbsp;solutions architect of Microsoft Austrialia. He told us about a great project they've been doing for the Austrialian Commonwealth Back of Australia (CBA) based on Smart Clients and many back-office systems. </p> <p>The cool thing about this project is that it involved creating a lot of framework development. Amongst them is an idea that eventually resulted in something what we now all know as the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/smartclient/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Composite%20UI%20Application%20Block">Composite User Interface Application Block</a>. </p> <p>At that time he told me that his team was working on a white paper about this project, its architecture and&nbsp;the technical solutions. Well, it took almost a year to complete this paper, but last month, the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb190159.aspx">complete story</a> has been release as a case study. Make sure you check it out (there's a PDF version as well). It's full of great ideas.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Update</strong>: By the way, if you live in the Netherlands, and you're subscibed to the Dutch version of the .NET Magazine, my collegue Jonne Kats wrote a great introduction to CAB and the Smart Client Software Factory.</p>
