It seems that Microsoft has finally acknowledged the sheer amount of requests for supporting <span>WSS 3.0 in Team Foundation Services. I've always found it a huge issue that we have a great portal environment such as MOSS 2007 on one end, and an out-of-date TFS team site based on WSS 2.0. There have been some great community efforts that seem to work okay, but basically rendered the installation useless when upgrading to newer versions.<br /><br />Well, in the approach to Visual Studio "Orcas", they've released a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/archive/2007/04/14/Configuring-Visual-Studio-2005-Team-Foundation-Server-with-Windows-SharePoint-Services-3.0.aspx">document </a>that should provide decent guidance on upgrading to WSS 3.0. If I can find the time, I'm going to try it out and report on it through this blog.</span>
