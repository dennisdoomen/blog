<p>During Wednesday's lunch, the second round of the 2006 TechED Idols Contest completed with another&nbsp;wave of three speakers. </p> <p>The first one, an Italian student (part of the 2006 Imagine Cup winner team), showed a very nice demo of a Windows Sidebar Gadget hooked up to a Bluetooth heartrate monitor. He had a bad Italian accent that made him difficult to understand, and somehow none of the speakers have managed to stay within the proposes five minutes. </p> <p>The next one, a UK guy living in Austria&nbsp;spoke so fast that nobody must have been able to keep up with him (even the native speakers).&nbsp;Then again, explaining ASP.NET AJAX extenders in five minutes is quite a challenge on itself. He definitely lost the group rightaway.</p> <p>The third one, some East-European guy could&nbsp;barely speak English, so not worth mentioning. I'm astonished he actually came through the initial submission selection. But the fourth one, somebody&nbsp;who&nbsp;gained access through one of the wildcards that were made available to the audience,&nbsp;was not bad at all.&nbsp;He was a Romanian guy that presented (in good English) some stuff about user interface design. </p> <p>Overall, this wave&nbsp;was not up to the standards set&nbsp;by the raw&nbsp;presentation power displayed during the yesterday's first wave. To my surprise, the Italian guy won this wave. I'm now starting to doubt what really excites the judge...</p>
