Maybe you have heard of <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/">Enterprise Integration Patterns</a>. It's a pattern language for common solutions for integrating cross-platform application and systems. BizTalk is one of those products dedicating their lives to enterprise integration. <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/docs/integrationpatterns_biztalk.pdf">This</a> great article written by people from ThoughtWorks provides a nice real-life example of usage of those patterns and possible implementation using BizTalk 2004.
