<p>For the attendees who have visited my two sessions on building a service oriented architecture using architectural best practices, check out the introduction slides <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/Attachments/Building%20SOA%20System%20Part%201%20Introduction.pptx">here</a> and the slides with best practices over <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/Attachments/Building%20SOA%20System%20Part%202%20Best%20Practices.pptx">here</a>. Also, build 2187 of the demo application can be downloaded from this <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/Attachments/AvSol.Education.Services.build2237.zip">location</a>. </p><p>In the next couple of months, I’ll continue updating the demo code with additional best practices which I’ve already collected but did not found the time to include yet. If you have suggestions or questions, don’t hesitate to contact me on my email (<a href="mailto:dennis.doomen@avivasolutions.nl">dennis.doomen@avivasolutions.nl</a> or <a href="mailto:dennis.doomen@gmx.net">dennis.doomen@gmx.net</a>). Also, some of my colleagues will be starting to build several frontends for the demo application using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb264518.aspx">Web Client Software Factory</a>, the new <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC Framework</a>, and of course, <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight 2.0</a>. I’ll use the blog to notify anyone who’s interested about new builds.</p><p>Finally, I noticed a lot of discussions and questions during the sessions, and there was simply not enough time left to answer or complete all of them. Therefore, I’d like to organize a so-called Chalk’n’talk session (a.k.a. a pizza-session) at Aviva Solutions in Leiden in which we can continue an open discussion on software factories, architecture, design patterns and the stuff Patterns &amp; Practices provides. No date is planned yet, but it will happen soon after the <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/">PDC2008</a>, so if you like to be included, let me know.</p><p><strong>Update 10-10-2008: </strong>I forgot to update the web.config, so the services did not work. Please get the update .zip from the same location.</p>
