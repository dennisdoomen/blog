<p align="left">Well, not a real theater though, but nevertheless, I'll be speaking at two events planned in the next two months. </p>  <ul>   <li>     <div align="left">On Saturday the 6th of September, the Dutch .NET community will be organizing <a href="http://www.codecamp.nl/" target="_blank">CodeCamp</a>, an interactive event intended for developers by developers. I'll be hosting a Chalk 'n' Talk session on software architecture in .NET and everything related to that. Because the intention of this session is to have an open and lively technical discussion on the impact of all those recent .NET technologies (P&amp;P factories, SOA, SilverLight, MVC) on software architecture, it is mostly hosting I'll be doing (rather than boring you with my voice). My session will start at 16:15, and most attendees will be quite tired by then (I know, I'll be), so if you think you'll have trouble staying awake, join me.         <br /></div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Next is the <a href="http://www.sdc.nl/" target="_blank">SDN Conference 2008</a> on the 6th and 7th of October. This event expects between 400 and 500 attendees and hosts many national and international speakers, including myself. I'll be doing two sessions on building a service oriented system using the components and guidance Patterns &amp; Practices offers. The first one is the <a href="http://www.sdc.nl/Default.aspx?tabid=71" target="_blank">introduction session</a> (advanced level) and explains the constraints and goals of such a system, elaborates on the technical design (layering, choices) and shows how P&amp;P facilitates them. The second session (expert level) continues on the introduction and discusses many technical <a href="http://apps.sdn.nl/speakersandsessions/SessionInfo.aspx?Id=AR.02" target="_blank">best practices</a> of gaining the most from the .NET Framework and the Enterprise Library 4.0.</div>   </li> </ul>  <p align="left">Oh, and if you get a chance, try to convince your manager to allow you to visit this year's <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/" target="_blank">Professional Developers Conference</a> in Los Angeles, the most important conference of all. It was canceled last year, so this one promises to be especially spectacular. </p>
