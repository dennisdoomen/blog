<p>It has been more than six weeks since the last drop of the next generation service factory was released.&nbsp;Since this&nbsp;is way more than the usual two-week schedule, you may wonder what has been going on...well...a lot! </p> <p>After going through the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=13815">pain</a> of migrating&nbsp;our existing&nbsp;models (the internal XML format has changed considerably), we (me and three other developers) have been using&nbsp;this&nbsp;build&nbsp;for the entire day. These are our first experiences:</p> <p><b>Improvements</b> <ul> <li>An installer that saves you from having to build everything yourself (although the source code is installed as a .msi file). However, you can't create your own installer yet, but P&amp;P is working on that. </li> <li>Support for GAX 1.3 (although building your own version of the factory from the source code does require some manual changes).  <li>Primitive members of a Data Contract support a CollectionType property. Message Contract members will get similar support in the next drop. <li>Primitive members of a Message Contract support an IsNullable property.  <li>Models open up much quickly than before.  <li>You can force generating code to a&nbsp;dedicated code folder&nbsp;of the implementation project (e.g. GeneratedCode)  <li>The Create Translator recipe from the v2 factory has been added.  <li>There are new recipes for creating the implementation projects with one click of a button </li></ul><b>Bugfixes</b> <ul> <li>The model project can be placed anywhere in the solution, for instance,&nbsp;as a sibling of&nbsp;the&nbsp;target projects such as is so common in the v2-style <em>Service Interfaces </em>solution folder.  <li>Specifying the XmlSerializer as the SerializerType now generates proper code  <li>Visual Studio no longer attempts to check out model files when opening from source control  <li>You can now add empty Message Contracts without causing validation errors. This allows&nbsp;adding&nbsp;unforeseen new members to a request&nbsp;message&nbsp;without breaking existing clients.</li></ul> <p><b>Issues</b></p> <ul> <li>The Order property of a Data Contract attribute must be unique. But a new recipe is under development to ease the effort of ensuring uniqueness.  <li>Can't select an existing service contract from the deployment designer. <li>Can't add a new model project to an existing solution&nbsp;(although a workaround exists). <li>Unexpected attempts to save the Data Contract model upon building the project (causing check-out requests). </li></ul>
