<p>I have been working for <a href="http://www.ordina.nl/">Ordina</a> for more than two years now, and&nbsp;looking at the many great and challenging projects I have participated in, I was planning to continue with that for a long time.&nbsp;Moreover, Ordina has been investing&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of time and resources in the development of their new .NET 3.0 and <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718368.aspx">DSL</a> based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_factory">software factory</a>.&nbsp;Several&nbsp;projects have been completed with it, and&nbsp;even more are about to start.&nbsp;And the best thing of it, is that I have had a decent&nbsp;&nbsp;part in its success. For instance, I got a chance to&nbsp;show off this&nbsp;factory&nbsp;at this year's TechED together with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/">Tom Hollander</a>, and I&nbsp;had many great things&nbsp;on the horizon.&nbsp;And&nbsp;last but&nbsp;not least,&nbsp;I have many fine and great collegues.&nbsp;So, you can safely conclude&nbsp;that I had no reason to change that...but I will...</p> <p>Quite recently, I have been contacted by a little company called <a href="http://www.avivasolutions.nl/">Aviva Solutions</a>. They primarily focus on providing consultancy services on enterprise solutions and&nbsp;e-commerce.&nbsp;Also, many of their consultants and architects&nbsp;dedicate their efforts on&nbsp;assisting customers with strategic choices on the architecture, the process, the infrastructure and the tools they use for building new systems.</p> <p>After many&nbsp;sleepless nights,&nbsp;I have decided to join Aviva Solutions in these efforts.&nbsp;Looking at&nbsp;the stuff I wrote above, you can imagine that&nbsp;this was a really difficult decision for me. Nevertheless, somehow, I really felt&nbsp;like this is something I must do. </p>
