<p>While installing the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1ff0b35d-0c4a-40b4-915a-5331e11c39e6&amp;displaylang=en">January 2007 CTP</a> of Visual Studio Codename Orcas, the next installment in the Visual Studio suites,&nbsp;I noticed something peculiar in the setup window.</p> <p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sv2gnsft17w/Ra-HyDNwAXI/AAAAAAAAAAM/rmhgGIswvTI/s400/orcas.jpg"> </p> <p>Is it really going to be called Visual Studio 2007? I do like the sound of it though. Unfortunately, installing this CTP on Windows Vista failed for me. I don't know why, but it continuously complains that a restart is needed before the setup continues. Uninstalling does not work either... to be continued..</p>
