As a coding standard evangelist, I've published standards for <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/standards/gemrcsharpcs.pdf">C# 1.0</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2006/07/c-20-coding-standard.html">C# 2.0</a>&nbsp;while working&nbsp;for my former employers. Moreover, I'm also somebody who tries to apply and&nbsp;share&nbsp;good design guidelines and principles. As part of that interest, obviously, I've read many books and articles on that subject. A former collegue of mine, ran into two great articles written by <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/default.aspx">Jeremy D. Miller</a> which I could not resist sharing with you. The first one, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2006/12/06/On-Writing-Maintainable-Code.aspx">On Maintainable Code</a>, shows some real-world examples on the subtle&nbsp;issues around this. The other one, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/01/08/Orthogonal-Code.aspx">Orthogonal Code</a>, focusses on some very essential design principles that everybody should use at all times.
