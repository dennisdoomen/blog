<p>Last Friday, I gave a talk on the P&amp;P software factories at the December edition of the <a href="http://www.sdn.nl/Default.aspx?tabid=266">Software Developers Event</a> in Ede. As can be expected from an enthusiastic audience, somebody asked me about the comparison/positioning of the Web Client Guidance Bundle's Model in relation to the new <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/tags/MVC/default.aspx">MVC Framework</a>. </p> <p>In response to that, check out the somewhat older announcement made by Glenn Block, product manager for the factory over <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2007/10/07/alt-net-headline-mvc-for-asp-net-is-coming.aspx">here</a>. For a comparison between the two patterns, check out these two excellent posts: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/simonince/archive/2007/11/22/the-asp-net-mvc-framework-using-the-wcsf-as-a-yardstick.aspx">The ASP.NET MVC framework, using the WCSF as a yardstick!</a> and <a href="http://ctrl-shift-b.blogspot.com/2007/08/interactive-application-architecture.html">Interactive Application Architecture Patterns</a>.</p>
