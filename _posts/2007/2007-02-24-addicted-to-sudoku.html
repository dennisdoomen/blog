<p>I've never understood the hype around the Sudoku puzzles, or maybe I simple never paid attention to it. But recently, while visiting my parents, my father told me about his newest addiction. Due to his enthousiasm, I've tried one myself. It's a bit getting used to, but eventually it worked for me as well. In the mean time, we bought a whole pocket bock full of Sudoku puzzels at some kiosk ranging from 1 to 4 stars.<br><br>Well, I'm officially addicted now. I've started with a few 1-star puzzles but worked myself up to the 4-star ones. Since these are usually too difficult to solve without making a lot of notes, I was looking for some nice Sudoku templates that have a bit more space.<br><br>My search completed with a great article by Michael Mepham about several <a href="http://www.sudoku.org.uk/PDF/Solving_Sudoku.pdf">advanced techniques</a> for solving a Sudoku. And his articles provides some great <a href="http://www.sudoku.org.uk/PDF/Solving_Sudoku.pdf">worksheets</a> as well. I suppose you can call somebody who performs research on how to solve Sudokus addicted, shouldn't I?</p> <p>Update 28-02: Check out this <a href="http://www.teunmooij.nl/javascripts/sudoku/sudoku.htm">link</a>. It's an online Sudoku game that you abuse for solving your paper-based Sudoku's as well.</p>
