<p>If you have, like me, been participating in the beta tests of the 2007 edition of Microsoft's Virtual PC, you should check out the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/Downloads/Downloads.aspx?SiteID=288&amp;wa=wsignin1.0">Microsoft Connect</a> site. They've released release candidate 1 (build 6.0.142) and it runs&nbsp;very smoothly&nbsp;under Vista&nbsp;on my HP laptop. Since I've been beta testing, I have not found any real problems while running it under Vista, but somehow, this new build made everything <em>flow</em> a little bit better.</p>
