<div>Recently, I've been giving presentations on topics such as C# 2.0 and ASP.NET 2.0 to some of the coworkers of Aviva .NET Professionals (a partner of Aviva Solutions). Usually that is not something worth blogging about. But yesterday evening's group was so full of enthousiasme, I couldn't resist sharing the enjoyment that I had while driving home. The picture is a bit blurry (and the powercable of the beamer is clearly visible), but you should be able to see the grin on my face (the guy with the blue-and-red shirt).</div><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_sv2gnsft17w/Rm-889Yu0hI/AAAAAAAAABI/Mr-SLeQD7ZY/s1600-h/groep1deel2.jpg"></a><p align="center"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sv2gnsft17w/Rm_GQNYu0iI/AAAAAAAAABU/sEkMwvJiNSs/s1600-h/groep1deel2.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5075493286843437602" style="CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sv2gnsft17w/Rm_GQNYu0iI/AAAAAAAAABU/sEkMwvJiNSs/s400/groep1deel2.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
