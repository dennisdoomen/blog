<p>This must be the first time I've actually been a witness of a Microsoft product being released while sitting next to the guy who did it. So it's done! The final bits of the new <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8130">Web Service Software Factory : Modeling Edition</a> have been release by Don Smith, the product planner from P&amp;P, right from the TechEd Barcelona 2007. </p> <p>I've already tried it on our running project, and all models opened up properly. Apparently, no changes were made to the internal structure of the models. If you are still using the pre-CTP version, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=16626">this post</a> may help you convert your existing models to the CTP version. </p> <p>I'll go through the issues and problems I have found in earlier versions and update the corresponding CodePlex items along with it. </p>
