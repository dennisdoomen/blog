<p>A very <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2007/07/03/gax-1-3-support-for-orcas.aspx">short</a>&nbsp;blog entry&nbsp;that triggered me. Hopefully, it will arrive soon, since that makes it potentially possible to use the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf">Web Client Software Factory</a> on a Visual Studio 2008 (Orcas) environment. For those guys that also use the V3 alpha drops of the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Wiki/View.aspx?title=V3Docs&amp;referringTitle=Home">Service Software Factory</a>, be patient. P&amp;P is planning to internally move to VS2008 somewhere in July, and deliver a proper VS2008 version in August or September.</p>
