<p>In just two days of working, our holiday starts.&nbsp;Me and my girlfriend Barbara have been considering taking our new <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sv2gnsft17w/Rg1cKMA4GDI/AAAAAAAAAAo/kLLEQXC-Xsg/s1600-h/V50_1.jpg">Volvo</a> and driving off to the south of France again. We enjoyed that holiday a lot last year, but we thought that we'll&nbsp;have plenty of opportunities for such a holiday as soon as we have kids. Instead, we decided to&nbsp;go for two weeks of pure relaxation at the <a href="http://www.sandoshotels.com/en/caracol/descripcion.php">Sandos Caracol Beach Resort</a>. Oooh, I can't wait...</p> <p><img height="283" src="http://images.straus.nl/mexico/hotels/rivieramaya.caracol01.jpg" width="427"></p>
