<p>I have been using Virtual PC 2007 since its first beta. Well, not voluntarily though, but simply because the 2004 version did not run properly on Windows Vista. Nevertheless, it has run like a charm since the very beginning. I've been using it to still do some leftover developments in Visual Studio 2003 on my laptop. No crashes, no strange lock-ups, no nothing. Well, yesterday, Microsoft finally <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx">released</a> version 1.0. And the best thing of it all? It's free! <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/operating_systems/virtual_pc_and_the_value_of_free.html">Apparently</a>, Microsoft is trying to gain&nbsp;some market space from its competitors.</p>
