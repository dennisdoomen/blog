<p>I've been using Windows Live Writer for a while now, but somehow it never worked properly from behind a firewall. Moreover, <a href="http://www.avivasolutions.nl/Pages/Home.aspx">Aviva Solution</a>'s <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/">weblog</a> is based on Sharepoint 2007, and WLW did not support this type of blog, up until now...</p> <p>The Live! team has released <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!1272.entry">beta 2</a> of Windows Live Writer. And obviously, this post has been written with this new beta from behind a firewall! I haven't been able to test with the MOSS blog (because WLW doesn't seem to like an ISA server in between), but I'm sure going to try real soon.</p> <p>The original <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2007/05/30/windows-live-writer-beta-2-with-sharepoint-2007-support-now-available.aspx">article</a> that pointed me to this new beta also mentions a soon-to-arrive add-on that adds additional blogging features to MOSS 2007.</p> <p>You can download beta 2 <a href="http://writer.live.com/">here</a>. A note to the Dutch readers, make sure you&nbsp;tweak your IE language settings in such a way that the English language is on top the list. If you don't, you'll end up at the Dutch version of <strong>writer.live.com</strong> which does not host the new WLV version. </p>
