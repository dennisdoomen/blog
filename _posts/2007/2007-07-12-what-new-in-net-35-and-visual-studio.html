<p><strong>Update July 25th: </strong>Huge signs that beta 2 will arrive <a href="http://searchvb.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid8_gci1265418,00.html">THIS</a> week.</p> <p><strong>Update July 16th: </strong>There are some '<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mgaur/archive/2007/07/16/vsd-team-signsoff-on-visual-studio-2008-beta2-literally.aspx">signs</a>' that beta 2 will arrive&nbsp;really <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/Software/re-58049_Visual_Studio_2008_Beta_2.aspx">soon</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most of the&nbsp;community information on <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700830.aspx">Visual Studio 2008</a> has been focussing on the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx">Language INtegrated Query</a> (LINQ) features of C# 3.0, but in fact, there's a lot more in stock for us. I've compiled a list of links that elaborate a bit more on all the other features Visual Studio 2008 will bring us&nbsp;at the official launch&nbsp;in Los Angeles on&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dajung/archive/2007/07/10/microsoft-announces-ship-date-of-next-generation-development-tools.aspx">February 27th 2008</a>. Since official launches typically occur a month or so before the RTM version shipped, it may well be possible that the RTM will ship around Christmas, but who will know... Anyway, many of the links originate from <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/">Daniel Moth</a>'s blog, since he has been posting a lot of really interesting stuff recently.</p> <ul> <li>First, check out this <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/06/net-framework-35.html">article</a>&nbsp;and this <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/06/visual-studio-2008-stack.html">post</a>&nbsp;to find out&nbsp;how .NET Framework 3.5 relates to 3.0 and 2.0 from a compatibility standpoint, and how they relate to the Visual Studio versions.&nbsp;  <li>Then you'll be happy to know that Visual Studio 2008 will completely replace Visual Studio 2005. It's new <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/03/netfx-support-in-vs-orcas.html ">multi-targetting</a> features allow developing .NET 2.0 and 3.0 applications&nbsp;without the <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/05/using-c-30-from-net-20.html">risk</a> of introducing .NET 3.5 or C# 3.0 dependencies.  <li>Finally! Javascript <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/21/vs-2008-javascript-intellisense.aspx">intellisense</a> for&nbsp;both <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/">ASP.NET AJAX</a> libraries as well as your own script libraries.&nbsp;Some additional examples can be found <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/webdevtools/archive/2007/03/02/jscript-intellisense-in-orcas.aspx">here</a>.  <li>WCF has been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/archive/2007/02/28/wcf-and-wf-in-quot-orcas-quot.aspx">extended</a> to add support for JSON web services that are compatible with ASP.NET AJAX, support for exposing services as RSS feeds, and support for new protocol versions (OASIS WS-AtomicTransaction 1.1, WS-ReliableMessaging 1.1, WS-SecureConversion 1.1. Expose Workflows as WCF services).&nbsp;&nbsp;  <li>The WPF designer has been&nbsp;enhanced and integrated into the IDE, WPF performance has been improvement in general, and support for <a href="http://silverlight.net/">SilverLight</a> is part of it as well.  <li>Support for <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/09/vs-2008-nested-master-page-support.aspx">nested</a> master pages.  <li>The ASP.NET webforms designer has been <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/02/08/my-first-look-at-orcas-presentation.aspx">redesigned</a>,&nbsp;including&nbsp;support for split views, faster design/source switching, enhanced support for stylesheet, and support for AJAX.  <li>DLINQ (<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx">LINQ to SQL</a>) should not be&nbsp;forgotten of course.&nbsp;  <li>XLINQ (<a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/05/systemxmllinq.html">LINQ to XML</a>)&nbsp;may potentially&nbsp;make the&nbsp;XmlDocument and XmlReader classes obsolete.  <li>Closely related to LINQ is the new <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa697427(VS.80).aspx">Entity Framework</a>, which is,&nbsp;from my point&nbsp;of view, a major&nbsp;competitor of the&nbsp;awasome <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html">NHibernate</a> object-relational mapper.&nbsp;  <li>Although not integrated in Visual Studio 2008, Microsoft's <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/default.aspx">Patterns &amp; Practices</a> team expects to ship the next generation of the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Wiki/View.aspx?title=V3Docs&amp;referringTitle=Home">Service Factory</a> at the same time. There are already some great alpha drops available (which&nbsp;work great in a production environment).  <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/p2p/archive/2007/03/12/writing-peer-to-peer-applications-using-net-part-1-pnrp.aspx">Peer-to-peer</a> classes that allow you to build applications that use technologies like People-Near-Me or instant messaging systems.  <li><a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/05/client-application-services-in-orcas.html">Client Application Services</a> that allow you to use the same authentication and profile services available in ASP.NET AJAX in a Windows application.  <li>Strong <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/05/accountmanagement.html">Active Directory</a> support.  <li>A new set of <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/03/systemaddin.html">classes</a>&nbsp;that can help you to&nbsp;add add-in support&nbsp;to yoru applications.&nbsp;  <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pablo/archive/2007/04/30/codename-astoria-data-services-for-the-web.aspx">Code Name Astoria</a>&nbsp;is a set of classes&nbsp;for exposing very lightweight XML or JSON based data services over HTTP. It is specifically targetted at rich client technologies such as ASP.NET AJAX and Silverlight.  <li>If you already know the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480482.aspx">Smart Client Software Factory</a>, you will recognize many of the concepts and patterns used in <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa139638.aspx">Code Name Acropolis</a>. It provides a flexible architecture for building Windows applications using Windows Presentation Foundation. The first CTP bits are already available.</li></ul> <p>If you want&nbsp;to read a&nbsp;great article that explains the troubles and challenges of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/">Pakeflages</a>-kind of site using ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX, the AJAX Control Toolkit, Windows Workflow Foundation, and DLINQ, read <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/ajax/makinggoogleig.asp">this</a>.</p>
