<p>Here are some of the highlights of the blog posts, articles and whitepapers I’ve read this month. </p> <ul> <li>In two short blog posts, <a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard">Jimmy Bogard</a> explains <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/08/22/busting-some-cqrs-myths">seven misconceptions</a> of CQRS and Event Sourcing, and also warns us of the impact of eventual consistency on the <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/08/23/cqrs-and-user-experience/">user experience</a>.  <li>Read about the many improvements ReSharper 7 offers for <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2012/08/javascript-improvements-in-resharper-7/">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2012/07/code-generation-improvements-in-resharper-7/">code generation</a>, <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2012/07/unit-testing-improvements-in-resharper-7/">unit testing</a> and <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2012/08/new-structural-refactorings-in-resharper-7/">new refactorings</a>.  <li>In their article <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html">Your Path through Agile Fluency</a> Diana Larsen and <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesshore">James Shore</a> (the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675">The Art of Agile Development</a>) define a different levels of agile using a system of stars. How many stars does your team have?  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/lunivore">Liz Koegh</a>’s brilliantly illustrates the essence of BDD when compared to TDD in her blog post <a href="http://lizkeogh.com/2012/05/30/showcasing-the-language-of-bdd/">Showcasing the language of BDD</a>.  <li>InfoWorld published a slightly ironic article on <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/10-practices-of-highly-ineffective-software-developers-199747">10 practices of highly ineffective software developers</a>. Which of those practices do you still practice?  <li>I recently read this old, but IMHO still very relevant article on how to properly practice <a href="http://gojko.net/2010/04/13/how-to-implement-ui-testing-without-shooting-yourself-in-the-foot-2/">UI testing without shooting yourself in the foot</a>. It is written by <a href="https://twitter.com/gojkoadzic">Gojko Adzic</a> an authority on specification-by-example.  <li>The better you get, the worse you get. Controversial isn’t it? But if you read the article <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2012/07/23/when-being-good-is-bad/">When Being Good is Bad</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jsonmez">John Sonmez</a> it will all make sense.  <li>How do you provide feedback to your colleagues? Is it as effective as you want? If not, consider reading <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/continuous-feedback-teams">Continuous Feedback in Agile Teams</a>.  <li>The August edition of MSDN Magazine included a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/jj573641.aspx">nice in-depth</a> explanation how the new <em>async</em> keyword in C# 5.0 works.  <li>Don’t you ever have those days that you feel unproductive? Then check out <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a>’s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProductivityVsGuiltAndSelfLoathing.aspx">tips for feeling better</a>.  <li>I still believe that he or she exists, but apparently super programmers are a <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2012/08/12/the-myth-of-the-super-programmer/">myth</a>.</li></ul>
