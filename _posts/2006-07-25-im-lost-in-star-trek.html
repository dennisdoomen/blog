<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009190/">J. J. Abrams</a>, the director and producer widely known for its hit-series <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index.html">Lost</a>, is going to direct the next installment of one of my favorite SF-series, Star Trek XI. This news is already public for a few weeks, but Startrek.com now sports a short <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009190/">interview</a> with him talking about the rumours related to the movies' storyline. The movie is supposed to be released in 2008, but they already have a <a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/19575.html">teaser poster</a> on their site right now!
