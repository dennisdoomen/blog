<p>Even though Aviva Solutions is still a relatively young company and we too have ‘noticed’ the changes in the economic climate, but we’re still growing steadily. Consequently, we are actively looking for medior and senior developers that are willing to join us in the journey of becoming the best Microsoft-focused company in the Netherlands.</p>  <p>Obviously thorough knowledge of the .NET platform is of essential importance to every developer within our company. But we do see some differences in the areas people naturally focus on. These include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Custom Development &amp; Software Factories </li>    <li>Integration </li>    <li>Information Worker </li>    <li>Business Intelligence </li>    <li>E-Commerce. </li> </ul>  <p>That doesn’t mean you have to choose between one of them, it just means that you may favor one area over the other <em>just now</em>. I, for example, am leading the Custom Development &amp; Software Factories theme including things like Application Lifecycle Management, Agile development and the many double-D practices (DDD, TDD, BDD). But I still keep an eye open for the things the other people are doing. This enables me to consider all options when challenged with a complex consultancy problem. </p>  <p>Regardless of your area of interest, if you're looking for a fresh change in your career, be sure to check out our <a href="http://www.avivasolutions.nl/Themas/Wees-zuinig-op-je-toekomst/Werk/Bij-Aviva-Solutions.aspx">career site</a>. Aviva Solutions currently employs almost 40 professionals, and of course we do have an informal but professional work environment, and yes, we do offer competitive conditions. But what makes us different from all those other IT companies is the passion with which we engage any challenge, and the freedom and acknowledgement that our two CEOs offer us. And I’m not even going to start on the <em>social event</em> we have each year in some warm and sunny country...</p>  <p>Anyway, if you’re interested send me an <a href="mailto:dennis.doomen@avivasolutions.nl">email</a> or call me at 0647-033908.</p>
