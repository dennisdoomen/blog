<p>Recently, I tried to uninstall Microsoft Office 2007 Beta 2 Technical Refresh so that I can go back to Office 2003 again. Even though&nbsp;the uninstallation completed succesfully, Office 2003 refused to install due to some residual leftovers. Trying to delete the physical files and some obvious references in the Registry did not help either. But as usual, Google came to the rescue with a <a href="http://pschmid.net/blog/2006/11/13/79">blog entry</a> that helped me solve this problem in a glitch.</p>
