I recently bought the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596008473/qid=1126504545/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-5040656-1459068?v=glance&s=books&amp;n=507846">Visual Studio Hacks</a> by James Avery (published by O'reilly). It is a great collection on tips &amp; tricks on Visual Studio 2003. It even includes a set of tips for the upcoming Visual Studio 2005. I was also happy to see that he recomments most of the 3rd party tools I use as well (e.g. Ghostdoc, Resharper). If you really want to get the most out of your development environment, check out that book.
