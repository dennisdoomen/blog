<p>As usual, I ran out of time big time, but still, it was a great evening. We continued until 21:45 and even though my throat was hurting as hell due to the flu, people were paying attention very well. TDD en testability are really difficult subjects and always cause a lot of discussion, but the discussion itself already proved some of the claims I made. So, I'm happy! </p>  <p>&#160;<a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sv2gnsft17w/SczZp1iCuEI/AAAAAAAAC3s/6h_XykFzMXw/s1600-h/DSCF1184%5B4%5D.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="DSCF1184" border="0" alt="DSCF1184" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sv2gnsft17w/SczZql9LxDI/AAAAAAAAC3w/hTVGMWkK68g/DSCF1184_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="625" height="470" /></a> </p>  <p>You can download the slides <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/Attachments/Design%20Patterns%20and%20Testability.ppt" target="_blank">here</a> and the code that shows all the examples I had in mind (and failed to show within the available time) <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/Attachments/DotNedDesignPatternsDemo.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
