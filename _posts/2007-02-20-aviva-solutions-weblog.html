As of last week, Aviva Solutions now has its own <a href="http://blog.avivasolutions.nl/default.aspx">weblog</a>. I will cross-post most of my technical stuff both on this blog as well as the new company weblog. The great thing about this weblog is that is had been created using the Weblog template of Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server 2007. I was surprised how easy it is to tweak the look-and-feel of a MOSS site (also refered to as <em>customization</em>).
