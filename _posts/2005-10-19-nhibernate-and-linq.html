Yesterday, two of my collegues demonstrated both NHibernate, an open-source object relational mapper, and the technology preview of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/">LINQ</a>, the C# 3.0 query language. I was quite impressed by the ease of use of <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=NHibernate">NHibernate</a>. Obviously, die-hard Java coders were already aware of the power of Hibernate for ages. LINQ, or Language INtegrated Query, allows .NET developers to use SQL-like keywords to query both databases an XML documents. The previous is still a bit buggy and incomplete, but the potential is obvious.
