Did you ever get bored with those obvious XML comments? Did you ever omit a comment because you were too lazy? Well, here comes GhostDoc...<br />I've already used NDoc (<a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net">http://ndoc.sourceforge.net</a>) for a few years, so I'm always eager to fill in the comments properly. But it is quite annoying that I have to type the documentation of an override again and again. GhostDoc adds a context-sensitive menu entry and a shortcut-key, and uses a intelligent configurable rule dictionairy to generate the comments from the definition, base-class member, etc. It even copies the documentation from the MSDN.<br />Check it out at <a href="http://www.roland-weigelt.de/ghostdoc" target="_BLANK">http://www.roland-weigelt.de/ghostdoc</a>.
