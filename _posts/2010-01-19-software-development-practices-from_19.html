<p>On Saturday February 27th, the Dutch <a href="http://www.dotned.nl/default.aspx">DotNED</a> user group, Aviva Solutions and Oosterkamp Training &amp; Consultancy will be hosting a full day session on software quality. The session will be mostly held by myself, but I will be accompanied by my colleagues Jonne Kats and Peter Hesseling. </p>  <p>Unfortunately, due to popular demand, the session was fully booked within 24 hours. But now, we are seriously considering repeating the session in the beginning of April. So if youâ€™re still interested, go to the DotNED <a href="http://www.dotned.nl/register/22/software-development-practices-in-de-praktijk.aspx">registration page</a> and click the link at the bottom of the page to send us an email. </p>
